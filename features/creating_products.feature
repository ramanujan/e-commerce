Feature: Creating Products

  Affinch√® gli utenti (buyer) possano avere dei prodotti da 
  scegliere, come utente (administrator) devo essere in grado di 
  creare facilmente i prodotti in vendita nel mio negozio. 
  
Background: 
  Given I am on the homepage
  And I follow "Go To Store Admin" 
  And I follow "Products"
  And I follow "Add New Product"
  And I fill in "Describe your product" with "Delicious vegetables used among other things, for the Tzazichi-Sauce"
  And I fill in "Selling price" with "1.50"
  
Scenario: Create a product
  And I fill in "Product title" with "Cucumbers"
  When I press "Create Product"
  Then I should see "Cucumbers was successful created! View it in your store or continue and create another product"

Scenario: Creating an invalid product
  And I press "Create Product"
  Then I should not see "Cucumbers was successful created! View it in your store or continue and create another product"
  And I should see "Title can't be blank"
